- technology hype often leads to unreasonable expectation
  + [[file:20210606221222-hype.org][hype]] relies on a selective amnesia for the unfulfilled promised of the past, that way enthusiasm is replenished
    - [seletive amnesia: how does it relate to the [[file:20210606221426-mandela_effect.org][Mandela Effect]]? Is it the opposite?]
- with the [[file:20210606221043-blue_brain_project.org][Blue Brain Project]] things weren't going as planned, then a bigger endevour was necessary: [[file:20210606221736-human_brain_project.org][Human Brain Project]], funded with a billion Euros by the EU
  + controversy, open letter by 800 neuroscientists disagreeing with [[file:20210606220207-henry_markram.org][Markram]]
- seeing simulated neural activity: how do you know whether the activity was right or wrong?
  + how can a perfectly fixed array of signals simulate the impredictability of biology?
    - bugs are quickly fixed while neurons don't always have perfectly fixed action potential, cells mutate and change impredictably
- Computational Neuroscience is gradually leaving behind biological brains in search of perfect algorithms
