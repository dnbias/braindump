Used to represent sets by rooted trees, each node containing one member and each tree representing one set
Each member points only to its parent. The root of each tree contains the representative, and is its own parent.
This data structure is used by the Kruskal Algorithm (minimum covering tree).

Asymptotically optimal implementation using these heuristics
- union by rank
  + ~rank~: greatest height in the three
  + Union using this info
    - attach the shortest tree to the longest one
- path compression
  + used by the Find-Set
  + update the parent of the Find-Set parameter, point directly to the root when found

Operations:
- Make-Set(x)
  + not in the family
  + creates singleton x
- Find-Set(x)
  + must be in the family
  + returns the representative of the set of x
- Union(x,y)
  + removes the sets of the two el., creates the union of these sets
  + Link(x,y)
