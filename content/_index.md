# Hello there! {#hi}

I'm [Daniel](https://www.dnbias.dev/), and you've chanced upon my braindump.
This website contains my working notes accumulated over some years. They're in a
really messy transition state: most of them are literature notes, and there are
close to no conceptual notes, which I intend to start taking soon.

I also haven't made good entry-points to my brain yet, but you can start hopping
around by going to the [full index](/posts/).

Have fun!
