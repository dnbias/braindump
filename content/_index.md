# Hello there! {#hi}

I'm [Daniel](https://www.dnbias.dev/), and you've chanced upon my braindump.
This website contains my working notes accumulated over the years.
Everything is a mess but it's slowly but surely getting better.

I also haven't made good entry-points to my brain yet, but you can start hopping
around by going to the [full index](/posts/) or the [tags](/tags/).

<i>~ See you space cowboy.</i>
