## Grammar {#grammar}

E --&gt; E "+" E

| E "-" E   |
|-----------|
| "-" E     |
| E "\*" E  |
| E "/" E   |
| E "^" E   |
| "(" E ")" |
| v         |


## Rules {#rules}

We want to build a parser that will

1.  Produce an error message if its input is not in the language of this grammar.
2.  Produce an "abstract syntax tree" (AST) reflecting the structure of the input, if the input is in the language of the grammar.

Each input in the language will have a single AST based on the following precedence and associativity rules:

-   Parentheses have precedence over all operators.
-   ^ (exponentiation) has precedence over unary - and the binary operators /, \*, -, and +.
-   \* and / have precedence over unary - and binary - and +.
-   Unary - has precedence over binary - and +.
-   ^ is right associative while all other binary operators are left associative.
