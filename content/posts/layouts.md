Optimization and insanity begin here.

-   `querty`, good ol' shit
-   `dvorak`
    -   nice alternating movement
    -   layout works well in non-english
    -   not `querty` based
-   `colemak`
    -   <https://dreymar.colemak.org/>
    -   optimized for adjacent finger movement
-   `workman`
-   `hands down`
-   `mtgap`

Then with a given layout and [QMK]({{< relref "qmk.md" >}}) or alternatives:

-   home row mods
-   callum style layers: <https://blog.ffff.lt/posts/callum-layers/>
-   for non-english typing [compose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key) seems to be the best solution
