Poem on [Death]({{< relref "death.md" >}}) by [Henry Scott-Holland]({{< relref "henry_scott_holland.md" >}})

> Death is nothing at all.
> It does not count.
> I have only slipped away into the next room.
>
> Nothing has happened.
> Everything remains exactly as it was.
> I am I, and you are you, and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged.
> Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.
>
> Call me by the old familiar name.
> Speak of me in the easy way which you always used.
> Put no difference into your tone.
> Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.
>
> Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.
> Play, smile, think of me, pray for me.
> Let my name be ever the household word that it always was.
> Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it.
>
> Life means all that it ever meant.
> It is the same as it ever was.
> There is absolute and unbroken continuity.
> What is this death but a negligible accident?
>
> Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight?
> I am but waiting for you, for an interval,
> somewhere very near,
> just round the corner.
>
> All is well.
> Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost.
> One brief moment and all will be as it was before.
> How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!
