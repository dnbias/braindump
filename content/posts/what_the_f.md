-   Why do politicians, editors and much of the public care about _words_ so much?
    -   it's not the concepts (there are synonyms), nor the sounds
    -   is profanity _corrupting_, most of all children? Thing is, to moralists in this matter, this property of this particular type of language is self-evident - there are no justifications other than that
    -   the answer from progressive writers:
        -   _true moralists should hold that violence and inequality are **obscene**, not sex and excretion._
    -   still, in the progressive sphere have been introduced linguistic taboos of their own - such as the N-word
        -   BUT, these words are part of fights for social equality and rights. They have a **political value** behind them not just a preoccupation for "decency"
-   it seems _bad language_ is a relative conception
-   **emotional power of swearing**
    -   curses provoke a different response that their synonyms because _connotations_ and _denotations_ are stored in different parts of the brain - related: **System 1** and **System 2** in [Thinking Fast and Slow]({{< relref "thinking_fast_and_slow.md" >}})
    -   limbic system - ancient network regulating motivation, emotion
        -   likely suspect is the amygdala - it lights up when a human is shown angry faces and taboo words
    -   neocortex - region highly developed in humans seat of perception, knowledge, reason, planning
    -   likely: denotations in neocortex left cortex - connotations in neocortex right hemisphere and limbic system
-   [Stroop effect]({{< relref "stroop_effect.md" >}}) - automatic nature of speech perception forces us to consider the unpleasant connotations of words against our wil
-   **historical root of swearing** in English and other languages
    -   religion - _profanity_ is that which is not sacred

-   oaths were the way people submitted a contingency to have others believe promises otherwise vain
    -   religion had this function, now social and legal contracts have it
    -   is US courts witnesses still have to swear on the Bible
    -   although the emotional power of religion dimmed the underlying psychology is still there
-   _fucking_ and derivatives are words trying to evoke the idea of exploitative sex on someone, so its not simply sex being demonized - its implying a power dynamic
