> A `qubit` is a vector of two complex numbers with unit length.

-   a qubit, unlike a bit that is either 1 or 0, is inherently probabilistic
    -   2 identical qubits may have different values once measured
-   a qubit once measured loses its quantum properties collapsing to one of two measurable states

> The combined state of multiple qubits is the tensor product of all the qubits.
