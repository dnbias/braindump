## Notes {#notes}

-   photos of people leaked
    -   various states of undress
    -   underage children
    -   uncensored faces
-   leaked by third party contract workers for data labeling
    -   violation that is bound to happen when independent workers try to collaborate on the web to raise productivity
-   corporation says the robot owners signed the _terms of service_
    -   of course these terms are vague on all the steps of data treatment
    -   users should not only be able to read the terms but _understand them_
        -   the complications of privacy are not easily understood by most people
    -   weird phrasing and distinctions (no data selling \\(\neq\\) no data sharing)
-   corporations have the data treated by third parties to raise productivity
    -   third party is not easily controlled
    -   internal data treatment can be protected and controlled through `NDAs` and corporation policy
        -   would be the most privacy-safe procedure
-   hacker found functionalities to _upload_ data even in products of which terms of service only defined data treatment as local
    -   should the corporation be blindly trusted?
-   corporations argue that facial data is necessary to develop AI tools to then automatically censor them in future data collection
    -   facial data may not be strictly needed
    -   silhouette data may be all that's needed
    -   synthetic data should be the norm, not user data
-   users are much more likely to accept data collection if a cute little robot is what's collecting and treating the data, in reality the data gets treated by humans in third world countries often
