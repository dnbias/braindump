-   technology hype often leads to unreasonable expectation
    -   [hype]({{< relref "20210606221222-hype.md" >}}) relies on a selective amnesia for the unfulfilled promised of the past, that way enthusiasm is replenished
        -   [[seletive amnesia]({{< relref "20211218000720-seletive_amnesia.md" >}}): how does it relate to the [Mandela Effect]({{< relref "20210606221426-mandela_effect.md" >}})? Is it the opposite?]
-   with the [Blue Brain Project]({{< relref "20210606221043-blue_brain_project.md" >}}) things weren't going as planned, then a bigger endevour was necessary: [Human Brain Project]({{< relref "20210606221736-human_brain_project.md" >}}), funded with a billion Euros by the EU
    -   controversy, open letter by 800 neuroscientists disagreeing with [Markram]({{< relref "20210606220207-henry_markram.md" >}})
-   seeing simulated neural activity: how do you know whether the activity was right or wrong?
    -   how can a perfectly fixed array of signals simulate the impredictability of biology?
        -   bugs are quickly fixed while neurons don't always have perfectly fixed action potential, cells mutate and change impredictably
-   Computational Neuroscience is gradually leaving behind biological brains in search of perfect algorithms
