[Percy Bysshe Shelley]({{< relref "20211218210816-percy_bysshe_shelley.md" >}}), 1818

> I met a traveller from an antique land,
> Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
> Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
> Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
> And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
> Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
> Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
> The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
> And on the pedestal, these words appear:
> <span class="underline">My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings</span>;
> <span class="underline">Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
> Nothing beside remains.</span> Round the decay
> Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
> The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
