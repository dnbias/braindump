## Notes {#notes}

-   the conversation with books happens in different steps and at different times
    -   note taking[^fn:1]
        -   summarizing
        -   outlining
        -   rewriting in your own words
    -   revisiting the notes[^fn:2]
    -   reading other work of the same author
    -   reading on the same argument from different sources
    -   rereading your notes on the subject in different times

[^fn:1]: To really digest a work of literature the output you put out from a book must be comparable to the input you are exposed to.
[^fn:2]: Otherwise the knowledge from the book will be lost to memory.
