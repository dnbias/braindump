## Instapaper {#instapaper}

-   read it later service
-   can send articles to Kindle
    -   [what about _not_ Kindle dammit]

Adrian doesn't feel like it's worth the pain sending articles to [Instapaper]({{< relref "instapaper.md" >}}) to  read them later. He feels it's more exiting to read them on site, when he finds them.

-   scraping the articles off markdown files to search for free and fast
    -   never run the risk of losing the source

Interesting idea, maybe too much of a pain. Also intense on the memory? It's getting cheaper and cheaper i guess.
