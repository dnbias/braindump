Found in [an article](https://mentalpivot.com/nets-and-knives-the-interplay-between-expansive-and-atomic-notes/) by [Mental Pivot]({{< relref "mental_pivot.md" >}}): atomic notes ([zettels]({{< relref "20210606214641-zettel.md" >}})) are the core of the [Zettelkasten]({{< relref "20200528213816-zettelkasten.md" >}}) method but more general, outline and summary type notes have their usefulness. These notes are like casting a _wide net_ gathering the interesting concepts in the source material.
These concepts if important enough to the Knowledge Base make it to atomic notes, knives.
