## Summary {#summary}

> This book provides a conceptual and technical introduction to the field of Linked Data. It
> is intended for anyone who cares about data – using it, managing it, sharing it, interacting with it
> – and is passionate about the Web. We think this will include data geeks, managers and owners
> of data sets, system implementors and Web developers. We hope that students and teachers of
> information management and computer science will find the book a suitable reference point for
> courses that explore topics in Web development and data management. Established practitioners of Linked Data will find in this book a distillation of much of their knowledge and experience, and a reference work that can bring this to all those who follow in their footsteps.
