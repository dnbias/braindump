This is a [Zettelkasten]({{< relref "20200528213816-zettelkasten.md" >}}) and what is also known on the web as a [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).
The work that inspired me to publish this is [Work with the garage door up]({{< relref "work_with_the_garage_door_up.md" >}}) and the [Learn In Public]({{< relref "learn_in_public.md" >}}) movement.
I think that having my working notes public for all to see creates a good kind of peer pressure, the kind that gets things done, possibly.

All the content is `WIP` and in a mix of languages, mainly italian and english. Sometimes I switch in between sentences. Scusate.

The website is based off the blueprint of [Jethro Kuan]({{< relref "20210604133348-jethro_kuan.md" >}})'s own [braindump](https://braindump.jethro.dev/). Everything is done in [Emacs]({{< relref "20200530210833-emacs.md" >}}) ([org-mode]({{< relref "20210705180740-org_mode.md" >}}) + [org-roam]({{< relref "20210604135308-org_roam.md" >}}) â™¡), converted to markdown compatible with [Hugo]({{< relref "20210705173431-hugo.md" >}}) and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
If you're curious look at my [github](https://github.com/dnbias/braindump).
