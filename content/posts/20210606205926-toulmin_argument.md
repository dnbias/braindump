-   Style of argumentation developed by philosopher [Stephen E. Toulmin]({{< relref "20210606210219-stephen_e_toulmin.md" >}})
-   Grounds ---&gt;Warrant---&gt;Claim
    -   Grouds being facts supporting the Claim
    -   Claim being an hypotesis, main argument
    -   Warrant (implicit or not) is what links the two.

-   Additionally: Qualifier, Backing
