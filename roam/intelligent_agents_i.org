* Agent
- interacts with an /environment/
  + could be anything
  + has *perception* of this environment (sensors)
  + can take *action* based on this perception (actuators)
- *reasoning* takes the agent from perception to action
  + this is the aspect studied in this course

* Classical Logic
- propositional logic
- first order logic

Can't classical logics be used?
- the problem is the information we have is not purely mathematical
- how do you model *Knowing*
  + $\text{Knowing}(X,Y)$
  + problem of extensionality
    - knowledge is not extentional
      + knowing something that is true *does not mean* knowing everything that is true
      + in =CL= true formulas are equivalent
  + facts can be inconsistent
    - $A$ is the case *and* $\lnot A$ is perceived $\implies$ anything
      + false implies anything
      + *principle of explosion*
  + monotone logic is not what we want
    - in implications we can add anything to the left side and the right will still hold
    - does not model exceptions to a rule
- *material implication* is not intuitive and does not make sense in real world applications

So the =CL= need to be extended to allow for reasoning in real world context.

* Logics
** Modal Logics
=ML=
*** Syntax
- alphabet
  + connectives
  + propositional symbols
  + parenthesis
  + 2 new connectives
    - $\square \quad \diamond$
- formula
  + $p \in PS | A \land B | ...$

The /box/ and /diamond/ can be interpreted as:
- depends of the context
- alethic logic
  + $\square A$ necessarily $A$
  + $\diamond A$ possibly $A$
*** Modal
/Qualifies the truth of a statement/
- can qualify if the truth is temporally qualified or necessarily qualified etc.
** Epistemic Logics
** Temporal Logics
** Multi-agent Logics
Express the individual knowledge.
