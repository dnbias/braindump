* Agent
- interacts with an /environment/
  + could be anything
  + has *perception* of this environment (sensors)
  + can take *action* based on this perception (actuators)
- *reasoning* takes the agent from perception to action
  + this is the aspect studied in this course

* Classical Logic
- propositional logic
- first order logic

Can't classical logics be used?
- the problem is the information we have is not purely mathematical
- how do you model *Knowing*
  + $\text{Knowing}(X,Y)$
  + problem of extensionality
    - knowledge is not extentional
      + knowing something that is true *does not mean* knowing everything that is true
      + in =CL= true formulas are equivalent
  + facts can be inconsistent
    - $A$ is the case *and* $\lnot A$ is perceived $\implies$ anything
      + false implies anything
      + *principle of explosion*
  + monotone logic is not what we want
    - in implications we can add anything to the left side and the right will still hold
    - does not model exceptions to a rule
- *material implication* is not intuitive and does not make sense in real world applications

So the =CL= need to be extended to allow for reasoning in real world context.

* Logics
** Proof Systems

*** Hilbert style
A *Hilbert style* proof system is more difficult to use as it requires creativity.
You start from any tautology and with it's rules it generates all true statements, this is elegant but it is not good for proof search. It is a so called *synthetic* proof system.
On the other hand a *Gentzen system* you start from the formula you want to prove and it is an *analytic* and *sequential*. It has a decision procedure, it is applicable by machines.

*** Tableaux calculus for K
*Semantic Tableaux* is a indirect proof system, *analytic*.

** Modal Logics
=ML=
*** Syntax
- alphabet
  + connectives
  + propositional symbols
  + parenthesis
  + 2 new connectives
    - $\square \quad \diamond$
- formula
  + $p \in PS | A \land B | ...$

The /box/ and /diamond/ can be interpreted as:
- depends of the context
- alethic logic
  + $\square A$ - necessarily $A$
  + $\diamond A$ - possibly $A$
- doxastic logic
  + $\square A$ - $A$ is believed to be true
- epistemic logic
  + $\square A$ - $A$ is known
*** Modal
/Qualifies the truth of a statement/
- can qualify if the truth is temporally qualified or necessarily qualified etc.
** Epistemic Logics
** Temporal Logics
** Multi-agent Logics
Express the individual knowledge.
