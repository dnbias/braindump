* Agent
- interacts with an /environment/
  + could be anything
  + has *perception* of this environment (sensors)
  + can take *action* based on this perception (actuators)
- *reasoning* takes the agent from perception to action
  + this is the aspect studied in this course

* Classical Logic
- propositional logic
- first order logic

Can't classical logics be used?
- the problem is the information we have is not purely mathematical
- how do you model *Knowing*
  + $\text{Knowing}(X,Y)$
  + problem of extensionality
    - knowledge is not extentional
      + knowing something that is true *does not mean* knowing everything that is true
      + in =CL= true formulas are equivalent
  + facts can be inconsistent
    - $A$ is the case *and* $\lnot A$ is perceived $\implies$ anything
      + false implies anything
      + *principle of explosion*
  + monotone logic is not what we want
    - in implications we can add anything to the left side and the right will still hold
    - does not model exceptions
* Modal Language
