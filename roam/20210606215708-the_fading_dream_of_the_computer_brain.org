- technology hype often leads to unreasonable expectation
  + [[id:d344457d-52db-4eff-ac4e-bac85b46f588][hype]] relies on a selective amnesia for the unfulfilled promised of the past, that way enthusiasm is replenished
    - [seletive amnesia: how does it relate to the [[id:5ee8018e-0996-439d-9874-ad5a886e3a7a][Mandela Effect]]? Is it the opposite?]
- with the [[id:173f4da0-00b2-418f-a4a2-651d5cf0f221][Blue Brain Project]] things weren't going as planned, then a bigger endevour was necessary: [[id:5301622e-1d9d-4019-977b-844f336ae6f5][Human Brain Project]], funded with a billion Euros by the EU
  + controversy, open letter by 800 neuroscientists disagreeing with [[id:7c6b1b2c-c7d1-408c-a159-b02be176bcb6][Markram]]
- seeing simulated neural activity: how do you know whether the activity was right or wrong?
  + how can a perfectly fixed array of signals simulate the impredictability of biology?
    - bugs are quickly fixed while neurons don't always have perfectly fixed action potential, cells mutate and change impredictably
- Computational Neuroscience is gradually leaving behind biological brains in search of perfect algorithms
