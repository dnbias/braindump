* Notes
- the conversation with books happens in different steps and at different times
  + note taking[fn:1]
    * summarizing
    * outlining
    * rewriting in your own words
  + revisiting the notes[fn:2]
  + reading other work of the same author
  + reading on the same argument from different sources
  + rereading your notes on the subject in different times

[fn:1]To really digest a work of literature the output you put out from a book must be comparable to the input you are exposed to.
[fn:2]Otherwise the knowledge from the book will be lost to memory.
