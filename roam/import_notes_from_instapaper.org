* Instapaper
- read it later service
- can send articles to Kindle
  + [what about /not/ Kindle dammit]

Adrian doesn't feel like it's worth the pain sending articles to [[id:3d9f45a2-ddf3-4920-9d09-148cd2fd7b43][Instapaper]] to  read them later. He feels it's more exiting to read them on site, when he finds them.
- scraping the articles off markdown files to search for free and fast
  + never run the risk of losing the source

Interesting idea, maybe too much of a pain. Also intense on the memory? It's getting cheaper and cheaper i guess.
