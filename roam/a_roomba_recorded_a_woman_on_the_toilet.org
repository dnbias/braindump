* Notes
- photos of people leaked
  + various states of undress
  + underage children
  + uncensored faces
- leaked by third party contract workers for data labeling
  + violation that is bound to happen when independent workers try to collaborate on the web to raise productivity
- corporation says the robot owners signed the /terms of service/
  + of course these terms are vague on all the steps of data treatment
  + users should not only be able to read the terms but /understand them/
    - the complications of privacy are not easily understood by most people
  + weird phrasing and distinctions (no data selling $\neq$ no data sharing)
- corporations have the data treated by third parties to raise productivity
  + third party is not easily controlled
  + internal data treatment can be protected and controlled through =NDAs= and corporation policy
    - would be the most privacy-safe procedure
- hacker found functionalities to /upload/ data even in products of which terms of service only defined data treatment as local
  + should the corporation be blindly trusted?
- corporations argue that facial data is necessary to develop AI tools to then automatically censor them in future data collection
  + facial data may not be strictly needed
  + silhouette data may be all that's needed
  + synthetic data should be the norm, not user data
- users are much more likely to accept data collection if a cute little robot is what's collecting and treating the data, in reality the data gets treated by humans in third world countries often
