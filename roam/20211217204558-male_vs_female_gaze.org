- media often cater toward a specific sex
  + this means the characters are portrait in very different ways
  + different characteristics
- the difference in promisquity can be observed from a social level and from the nature realm

- [[id:bf439187-1e08-4249-b33e-d3216bec6c63][David Buss]]
  + evolutionary psychologist have a theory about these differences in Female and Male
  + traits good for the survival of the species ([[id:8fbff06a-a8f9-42cc-ac4a-1bf39cf5dcbf][Natural Selection]]) will be most common in individuals
    * so male promiscuity and female pickiness should be traits developed to ease propagation of genes
- many speculate the number of /gametes/ of the sex to be a deciding factor in the difference in behavior and promiscuity
  + average male: 525 Bilion sperms
  + average female: 300 Thousand eggs by puberty

- [[id:ddb28682-53b0-4781-88ef-150a8c5e707e][Stereotypes]], what do them stem from?
  + /men = pigs/
    * /attractiveness/
      - in the evolutionary theory: used as an indicator of health and fecundity
    * stereotypical female in media:
      - attractive
      - not like other girls
      - "sex symbols"
  + /women = gold diggers/
    * status
      - /paternal investment/, higher in females just through gestation
      - lower testosterone in males in a relationship
        + most useful indicator of nurturing behavior
    * attractive/heathy less important
      - higher testosterone, higher
    * stereotypical archetype
      - good looks
      - sweet side
      - nurtiring and protective
    * Bieber study
      - the lyrics in the early albums:
        + sensitive
        + resourcefull
        + /sweet boy/
      - the lyrics in the later albums:
        + not cheesy anymore
        + more allusion to sex and drugs
          * in line with its demografic
  + many new web-stars in [[id:4f6e9ea7-2d4b-46e9-8e18-02d15de60805][TikTok]] and other [[id:909360ea-6b31-48b3-a4f4-54da0407fbd3][Social Media]] reach fame by following the male / female archetype

- BUT
  + everybody values positive characteristic
    * these are necessities, but to different degrees to different people
  + stereotypes cater to a younger demografic, more prone to idealize the opposite sex and unknown experiences
    * experience in the real world changes the point of view
