* Libraries
** Naif ver.

** Recursive ver.

** Dynamic ver.
The structure of the algorithm should still be recursive

* Application using the Dynamic Version
Taking a =dictionary= and a =sentence= as inputs:
- For all words with at least one possible correction suggests all the minimal possible corrections

Where:
- any word with a =edit_distance= > 0 has at least a correction found in the dictionary used
