#+begin_quote
Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination: If a poor student can't get a loan because a lending model deems him too risky (by virtue of his zip code), he's then cut off from the kind of education that could pull him out of poverty, and a vicious spiral ensues. Models are propping up the lucky and punishing the downtrodden, creating a "toxic cocktail for democracy."

* Notes
- =WMD= are problematic mathematical tools that are:
  + opaque
  + unregulated
  + difficult to contest
- they are highly scalable and in this way amplify the biases the human already have applying them to a larger population
- they create /pernicious feedback loops/ in that these models *create* the world that confirms their bias
  + these models make predictions based off data (usually *proxies* for what is being predicted, and poor ones often) and these predictions end up being new data points that confirm and reinforce the bias
- they end up damaging minorities and people from poor backgrounds, difficult upbringing
- they advantage people who are already advantaged in job selection, credit, judgement of any kind
- humans have a hard enough time explaining and understanding concepts like ethics, justice, empathy that it is obvious that models wouldn't reason through them as it is
- Cathy suggests three ways in which these instruments can be improved
  + use a lot of data
  + get feedback from the results to improve the data and the model
  + it should be clear how the model works, the types and amount of data, criteria, weights, why it makes a prediction
    - especially important when using proxies
