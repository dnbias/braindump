* Notes
- the objective is to integrate multiple real-time systems as guests on a single host using =VM=â€‹s
- in literature there are different takes on the matter
  + /mismatch between embedded-systems requirements and the virtual-machne model is evident in scheduling [...] the integrated nature of embedded systems requires that scheduling priorities of different subsystems must be interleaved. This is at odds with the concept of virtual machines./[fn:heiser The Role of Virtualization in Embedded Systems]
