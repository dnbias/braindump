Optimization and insanity begin here.
- =querty=, good ol' shit
- =dvorak=
  - nice alternating movement
  - layout works well in non-english
  - not =querty= based
- =colemak=
  - https://dreymar.colemak.org/
  - optimized for adjacent finger movement
- =workman=
- =hands down=
- =mtgap=

Then with a given layout and [[id:0ab8192a-5880-459d-a0a1-0692a503001f][QMK]] or alternatives:
- home row mods
- callum style layers: https://blog.ffff.lt/posts/callum-layers/
- for non-english typing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key][compose]] seems to be the best solution
