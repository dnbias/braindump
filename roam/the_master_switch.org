[[id:5a68c870-82d2-426e-b6f6-1d4150aa6d7b][Tim Wu]], /The Master Switch/, 2010, Knopf
- Stuff about this:
  + [[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/02/master-switch-tim-wu-review][the Guardian Review]]

* Notes
- Wu draws inspiration for the thesis of the book from the concepts of [[id:b92dee70-36a6-4603-ba30-b8dc7f8b5c2a][Creative Destruction]] and the studies of [[id:903628ae-cbc7-4c8d-ab84-8f8d13f3d70b][Schumpeter]]
  + this concept describes the way that industrial innovation in a capitalist systems tends to completely replace the previous status quo, in cycles of industrial growth
  + Wu argues that this dynamic gets arrested by monopolists that have the economic and political power to stop the competition from even having the possibility of innovating in this way
    - often controlling research and patents in their own labs and deciding when it is time to release innovation
- [[id:e230e415-df73-4871-bbfb-44d699b9ce12][Kronos effect]]
  + companies /eating/ their prole to stop the innovation from hurting their business
- power struggle and humanity crave for imperial control
  + Wu argues that the constitution did a good job in the last centuries in controlling this tendency in politics
  + this in the US got translated to free market capitalism with great power being detained by single entities or capitalists with monopolies
- the main argument of the book is that the information market different from others is being more susceptible to monopoly control in what Wu calls [[id:45b8650c-d7d1-4b0a-9c89-d7217f340d5f][The Cycle]]
- [[id:45b8650c-d7d1-4b0a-9c89-d7217f340d5f][The Cycle]]
  + all modern communications technology lived through it
    - telephone, radio, cinema, TV
  + the first years of the technology come with optimistic hopes for its effect on the human condition, great optimism and idealism over the *open* medium
  + the openness doesn' t last
    - big players argue that a single corporation can offer a much better product with a monopoly
      + this comes with great control over what can get communicated over the medium
  + /from somebody's hobby to somebody's industry/
  + /from freely accessible lane to one strictly controlled by a single corporation or cartel/
  + /from open to closed system/
  + does this apply to the web? nobody knows yet
    - modern-day risks can be found in the attempts at /vertical integration/ that for example Apple has been planning
- great personalities Wu uses to construct his claim
  + Theodore Vail with =AT&T= in long distance communications
  + David Sarnoff with =RCA= and =NBC= in radio
  + Adolph Zukor with Paramount and its control over distribution outlets
- [[id:ca257e7d-d900-4eed-b4d8-498445c315d6][Common Carrier]]
  + there are businesses so important to the correct functioning of our government and everyday life that must be free of bias and discrimination in their activity
  + concept that Wu adapts to the information and communication industry with what he defines as [[id:7a90e31b-7bfe-4979-89b6-c96ff95d0da9][Net Neutrality]]
