[[id:5a68c870-82d2-426e-b6f6-1d4150aa6d7b][Tim Wu]], /The Master Switch/, 2010, Knopf
- Stuff about this:

* Notes
- [[id:e230e415-df73-4871-bbfb-44d699b9ce12][Kronos effect]]
  + companies /eating/ their prole to stop the innovation from hurting their business
- power struggle and humanity crave for imperial control
  + Wu argues that the constitution did a good job in the last centuries in controlling this tendency in politics
  + this in the US got translated to free market capitalism with great power being detained by single entities or capitalists with monopolies
- the main argument of the book is that the information market different from others is being more susceptible to monopoly control in what Wu calls [[id:45b8650c-d7d1-4b0a-9c89-d7217f340d5f][The Cycle]]

  + all modern communications technology lived through it
    - telephone, radio, cinema, TV
  + the first years of the technology come with optimistic hopes for its effect on the human condition, great optimism and idealism over the *open* medium
  + the openness doesn' t last
    - big players argue that a single corporation can offer a much better product with a monopoly
      + this comes with great control over what can get communicated over the medium
  + /from somebody's hobby to somebody's industry/
  + /from freely accessible lane to one strictly controlled by a single corporation or cartel/
  + /from open to closed system/
  + does this apply to the web? nobody knows yet
    - modern-day risks can be found in the attempts at /vertical integration/ that for example Apple has been planning
- great personalities Wu uses to construct his claim
  + Theodore Vail with =AT&T= in long distance communications
  + David Sarnoff with =RCA= and =NBC= in radio
  + Adolph Zukor with Paramount and its control over distribution outlets

  + there are businesses so important to the correct functioning of our government and everyday life that must be free of bias and discrimination in their activity
  + concept that Wu adapts to the information and communication industry with what he defines as [[id:7a90e31b-7bfe-4979-89b6-c96ff95d0da9][Net Neutrality]]
