* Cycle of Analytics
** Preprocessing
- data transformation
- data reduction
  + in *big data* situation it is wise to choose a subset of the data to query.
  + reduce attributes or data
  + different strategies
    - *dimensionality reduction*
    - *numerosity reduction*
      + sampling
        - random selection, performance might suffer because of skew in the data
        - stratified sampling
- cleaning of data
- integration of data
  + *assumption*: the data we have is incomplete
- data privacy concerns have to be considered

To accomplish this you can use visualizations, ask a domain expert.

*NB* there is no straightforward way to do all this, it takes intelligent thought.

The first goal is to arrive to a *clean and complete dataset*, one that fulfills the requirements.

** Interpretation
Statistics is not everything, the data experts/domain experts need to interpret the information the =ML= application produces.

From the novelties you extract from the data you take *action* based on them.
