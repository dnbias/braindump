* Summary
* Notes
- *kernel*: the mandatory part of the operating system common to all other software
  + uses safety-critical features of the processor that user-mode software cannot use
- *monolithic vs micro*
  1. the complete =OS= is packed in a single kernel
  2. minimize the kernel and implement servers outside of it
     - the basics are: address space, =IPC=, basic scheduling
