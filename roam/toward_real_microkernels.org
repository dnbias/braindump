* Summary
* Notes
- *kernel*: the mandatory part of the operating system common to all other software
  + uses safety-critical features of the processor that user-mode software cannot use
- *monolithic vs micro*
  1. the complete =OS= is packed in a single kernel
  2. minimize the kernel and implement servers outside of it
     - the basics are: address space, =IPC=, basic scheduling
     - treat the servers exactly as other programs, they run in user-mode

- this idea was born in the late 1980s
- clear theoretical advantages of the microkernel paradigm
  + different =APIs=, file systems, operating system strategies could coexist in the same system
  + system is flexible and extensible, can be easily adapted to new hardware and application, only some servers need to be modified for this
  + system is contained and easier to manage, less error prone
  + system is modular
  + interdependencies between different parts could be restricted and reduced (=TCB= is smaller)[fn:TCB the Trusted Competing Base]

The expectations met reality when some problems arose
