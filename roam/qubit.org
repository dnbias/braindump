#+begin_quote
A =qubit= is a vector of two complex numbers with unit length.
#+end_quote
- a qubit, unlike a bit that is either 1 or 0, is inherently probabilistic
  + 2 identical qubits may have different values once measured
- a qubit once measured loses its quantum properties collapsing to one of two measurable states

#+begin_quote
The combined state of multiple qubits is the tensor product of all the qubits.
