The law of unintended consequences, often cited but rarely defined, is that actions of people, and especially of governments, always have effects that are unanticipated or "unintended." Economists and other social scientists have heeded its power for centuries; for just as long, politicians and popular opinion have largely ignored it. -- [[https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/540/handouts/french/unintconseq.html][sas.upenn.edu]]
