Theory of queueing networks based on these assumptions:
- system modeled by a /stationary stochastic model/
- jobs /stochastically independent/
- jobs steps from device to device follow a [[id:55ef9c8d-93cf-42fb-ae5b-4e31397e9e56][Markov Chain]]
- system in /stochastic equilibrium/
- service time requirements for each device comform to a /exponential distribution/
- system is /ergotic/[fn:ergotic]

[fn:ergotic] long-term time averages converge to the values computed for stochastic equilibrium
