* Setting Up the Environment
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk

The authors use Anaconda w/ [[id:b7330c27-133a-4c8a-9e5b-17f8c1d71f0b][Python]] 3 and the Conda package manager for the qsharp packages.

On arch the =anaconda= package on the =AUR= installs everything but you need to add it to =PATH=:

=PATH=/opt/anaconda/bin$PATH=

Then you set the environment via =environment.yml= in the book's repo.

=$ conda env create environment.yml=
=$ conda activate qsharp-book=
- for this =conda= needs to be set up on the console (=bash=, =zsh=, ...)

After this the last thing to setup is =dotnet=, download the appropriate =Core SDK=.
Install project templates:

=$ dotnet new -i "Microsoft.Quantum.ProjectTemplates"=

and to use them:

=$ dotnet new console -lang Q# -O MyProject=

Then to have language hinting on =VS Code= you need to install the extension =Microsoft Quantum Development Kit=
- not available on the FOSS version of =VS Code= on the =AUR=

For Jupyter Notebooks you can install =IQ#=

=$ dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.Quantum.IQSharp=
=$ dotnet iqsharp install=
