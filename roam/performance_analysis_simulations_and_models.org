* Systems
This course focuses on systems that are:
- stochastic
- dynamic
- discrete-event

* Introduction
** Discrete-event simulation
- purpuse, modeling - simulating - analyzing systems
- way, computation and mathematical techniques
- experiments on the model

A *model* is a conceptual framework describing a system
The simulations are going to use *Montecarlo* based techniques

Model Development (typically done iteratively):
1. Goals and objectives
2. Build a /conceptual model/
3. Convert into a /specification model/
4. Convert into a /computational model/
5. Verify
6. Validate

** Formalisms
- *Queueing Networks*
  - concurrency
  - congestion
- *Stochastic Petri Nets*
  - concurrency
  - congestion
  - sychronization
