* The Good
- context throught side by side content: [[id:382632ea-6c46-4dc0-a02f-acd867750c8f][marginalia]]
  + always been the power of the written word
- here comes the Intenet with bidirectional links
  + closer to out brain convolutedness

* The Less Good
- link are distracting
  + a flood of links is cumbersome on the eyes
  + but they are /great/ for note-taking and expanding on ideas
  + for someone tryng to follow a logical thread the links get confusing quickly
    * _links are rabbitholes_ the reader might never emerge from
- [[id:27428ecf-50c6-4e45-8a3c-ab03b8fca95a][Project Xanadu]] is cool and all but results in pretty but confusing lines[fn:1]

* Dilution of Meaning
- links water down meaning
  + in linking you are hiding behind someone else'sh writing[fn:2]


[fn:1] right but hypertext is a great tool, it has to be used with purpose
[fn:2] /write better/, if you can't then link somewhere
