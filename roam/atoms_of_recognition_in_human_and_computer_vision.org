* Claim
Introducing and using minimal recognizable images show that the human visual system uses features and processes that are not used by current models and that are critical for recognition.

* Notes
#+begin_quote
A =MIRC= is an image patch that can be reliably recognized by human observers and which is minimal in that further reduction in either size or resolution makes the patch unrecognizable.
#+end_quote

- *minimal recognizable images*
  + a minimal change in the image can have drastic effect on the recognition
    - this identifies crucial features
    - /phase transition/ phenomenon
- *Mi*​nimal *r*​ecognizable *c*​onfigurations (=MIRCs=)
  + the task is computationally difficult as each one is non-redundant
    - requires effective use of available information

- training on full-object images
  + AP 0.07 \plusmn 0.10
- training on =MIRC=
  + AP 0.74 \plusmn 0.21

- results indicate the human visual system uses features and processes that current models do not
  + the sharp drop in recognition at the =MIRC= level indicate similar visual representations in humans
    - the transition occurs for the same images
  + feed-forward or top-down processes?
