* Principles
** Computer Security and Software Development
*** Software Life Cycle
*** Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
*** Authentication & Access Control
*** Software Vulnerabilities
** Computer Architecture
* Memory Attacks and Defenses
** Buffer overflow
Can occur with languages with no built-in memory defense.
- =C=, =C++=

A buffer is a data container, sequence. An array basically.
** Heap overflow
** Integer overflow
** String format vulnerabilities
** Type confusion
** Use After Free
* High Level Attacks and Defenses
** SQL injection
** OS command injection
** Cross-Site Scripting
** Confused deputy
* Finding Software Vulnerabilities
** Static Program Analysis
** Dynamic Program Analysis
