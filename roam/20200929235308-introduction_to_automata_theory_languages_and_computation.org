=def= Automata is the study of abstract computing devices - machine

* A finite-state automaton
    has a finite number of states to remember his history
    - Inputs cause the automa to change its state

*** automaton part of a lexer

* Basic Concepts

** Alphabets
    \(\Sigma\)
    a finite, nonempty  set of symbols

*** powers of alphabets
    with \(\Sigma^k\) we express the set of strings in the \(\Sigma\) alphabet with length \(k\)

** Strings
    a finite sequence of symbols chosen from some alphabet
    \(\epsilon\) - the empty string

** Languages
    a set of strings chosen from \(\Sigma^*\)

* Regular Languages
   A language \(L\) is regular if there is a =DFA= \(A\) so that
        \(L(A)=\{w \mid \hat{\delta}(q_0,w) \textrm{ is in }F\}\)

* Deterministic Finite Automata
    An automata that is in a _single state_ after reading any sequence of inputs
    The five-tuple describing a =DFA=:
         \(A = (Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)\)

    The transition function can be extended:
         \(\hat{\delta}(q,w)=\delta(\hat{\delta}(q,x),a)\)

    The language is defined as
        \(L(A)=\{w \mid \hat{\delta}(q_0,w) \textrm{ is in }F\}\)

* Nondeterministic Finite Automata
    Can be in _several states at once_
    they accept the exact same regular languages that dfa do
    * they are easier to design
    * always possible to convert an NFA to a DFA
      + in the worst case a DFA can have \(2^n\) states with \(n\) being the number of states of the NFA
      + proof through _subset construction_

    The language is defined as
        \(L(a) = \{w\mid\hat{\delta}(q_0,w)\cap F\neq 0\}\)

* Regular Expressions
    denote the structure of data
    _they describe exactly the same patterns as what can be described by finite automata_

* Complexity

** Decidability
    What can a computer do?

** Intractability
    What can a computer do efficiently?

    =def= NPhard - intractable problems
