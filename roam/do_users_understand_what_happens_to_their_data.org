* Evidence
- [[id:b3c77525-a769-4d6e-af26-60141a415001][Data treatment often outsourced to third-world countries]]
- [[id:3419fea7-4a57-4349-a182-9394de3313d7][A robot collecting the data does not mean the treatment will be automatic]]
- [[id:67046dcb-70c0-4fb6-aa85-e145814e6825][Users are more likely to let a robot collect their data than a human]]
* Conclusion
- [[id:bf6bac49-f8aa-4505-9b37-fd2fe440a2d3][Users are often deluded their raw sensitive data will not be seen by other people]]
